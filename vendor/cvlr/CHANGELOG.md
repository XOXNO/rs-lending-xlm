## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-28

# Changes
 - implementation of NativeInt into u128 conversion using new Prover intrinsic

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
  - `cvlr-spec`: lemmas, predicates, formulas (including two-state), and macros to generate rules from specs
  - `cvlr-decimal` with CVLR logging for decimals
  - `cvlr_eval_that!` / `cvlr_eval_all!` to evaluate the assert-that DSL as boolean Rust code
  - Richer `cvlr_assert_that!` behavior (e.g. `if`/`else`) and scope logging around asserts and assumes

### Changed
  - `CvlrBoolExpr` renamed to `CvlrFormula`; `cvlr_impl!` renamed to `cvlr_implies!`
  - `cvlr` re-exports the new spec and decimal crates

### Fixed
  - Macro expansion issues in asserts, assumes, lemmas, and generated temporaries (ordering, scopes, empty lists, grouped expressions)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-19
### Fixed
  - Restored missing functionality in the `clog!` macro.

### Added
  - Introduced the `cvlr-derive` crate for custom derive macros
  - Implemented derives for the `CvlrLog` and `Nondet` traits
  - Added new assertion macros:
    - `cvlr_assert_if!` for guarded (conditional) assertions
    - `cvlr_assert_that!`, a macro supporting a simple DSL for assertions that produces detailed information in counterexamples
    - `cvlr_assert_all!` for asserting a list of expressions at once
    - `cvlr_assume_that!` and `cvlr_assume_all!` to mirror their assertion counterparts for making assumptions instead of assertions

## [0.4.2] 2025-12-19
### Fixed
  - `NativeFixed::to_bits` overly conservative assumption
### Added
  - `cvlr_log_impl!` macro to help implement `CvlrLog` trait
